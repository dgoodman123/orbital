                    In the year 2208, you work as an engineer on the Elusa, a defensive space station orbiting Earth. You sit, eating, in the mess hall with a friend of yours, a radar operator. The station's artificial gravity keeps your boots anchored firmly to the ground.<br><br>
                    Your friend speaks to you in a hushed tone of voice. <fd>"Back on Earth, you worked at the Redbird Indoor Farms, right?"</fd><br>
                    <pd>"Yup. Hard job, but necessary,"</pd> you reply.<br>
                    <fd>"Suppose Operation Redbird happened tomorrow. Around how many people would starve?"</fd><br>
                    <pd>"When I left the farms, we had enough land and UV lamps to indefinitely feed around half the global population."</pd><br>
                    She puts her head in her hands. <fd>"Only half?"</fd><br>
                    <pd>"Only half."</pd><br>
                    <fd>"We've noticed something on the radar. It's around half a kilometer in diameter, and moving towards Earth at 90% the speed of light."</fd><br>
                    You have trained for this eventuality since the day the government drafted you to the Elusa. <pd>"When will it arrive?"</pd><br>
                    <fd>"Around fifteen hours. I've run some calculations with its velocity and estimated mass. Earth would be split in two. No survivors. But if we underwent Operation Redbird and moved the Earth away from the Sun, the ensuing famine would kill half of the population. The other half fed by the farms, of course."</fd><br>
                    <pd>"So... Why am I hearing about this from you?"</pd><br>
                    Your friend lowers her voice. <fd>"We've obviously noticed an alien weapon - plenty of extraterrestrials want humanity off the map, and have the means to do so. But opinions in the radar room vary widely. Some us think that the object has come to destroy Earth, others maintain that the radar has picked up a transport craft.<br><br>"But if it had picked up a transport craft, we would have received some transmission from them notifying us of their arrival. I need a favor from you."</fd><br>
                    <pd>"What kind of favor?"</pd><br>
                    <fd>"To perform Redbird, the Elusa would need to grab the Earth with our tractor beam. Then we would fire up the T-warp engines and drag Earth to safety. This only takes three people - one to operate the tractor beam, one for the engines. And of course, one to make sure that the rest of the crew doesn't interfere. I've already found someone for the tractor beam - a guy named Endelay who has been maintaining the tractor beams for years - and I myself will worry about the crew. You need to operate the engines. Go down in history."</fd><br>

                    You both finish your food in silence. Afterwards, you work your shift in the engine, doing scheduled maintenance.<br><br>
                    That night, you return to your bunk, and set your alarm for earlier than usual.<br><br>
                    The beeping shatters your sleep, and you feel a little groggier than usual. Still, you manage to find your limbs and climb from your bunk. You begin to sneak to the engine room, which should take around three minutes. Dim fluorescent lights show the worn metal path before you. But as you near your destination, you cross paths with a man you don't recognize.<br>
                    <od>"Hey. What are you doing, working this hour? What's your name?"</od><br>

                    You tell the man your name, and make up an excuse. <pd>"The secondary fuel rod of the T-warp had overheated, so they called me over here to diagnose and fix the problem."</pd><br>
                    The man seems satisfied with this answer, and wanders away from you. From what you know about the architecture of the ship, he seems to be heading away from the tractor beam control panel.<br><br>
                    You enter the engine room. In front of you, an elaborate array of switches and buttons sits unprotected. You heat up the engines, so that at the flick of one tiny switch on the control panel, all of Earth could be displaced. You check your standard-issue watch, waiting for exactly 3:00. But at 2:59 and 20 seconds, a shudder runs through the Elusa's floor, nearly knocking you off your feet. Cluttered tools on the nearby shelves clatter to the ground. It lasts just one second - the Elusa holds still again, and a robotic voice comes over the intercom: <ad>"ALERT: Breach in starboard airlock. All crewmembers, move to escape pods for evacuation."</ad><br><br>

                    <od>"At three in the morning? Come with me."</od><br>
                    The man - you now see that he has a patch reading "Elusa Security Force" on the back of his shirt - takes you to the Elusa's brig, and locks you inside. You hear him say through a radio, <od>"There's been an attempt to hijack the Elusa. Any available officers, monitor the tractor beam."</od><br>
                    You grab at the bars of the brig, and try to explain the situation. He refuses to listen.<br><br>
                    As you languish, you feel gravity's grip start to loosen. The Earth has been split in two.<br><br>
